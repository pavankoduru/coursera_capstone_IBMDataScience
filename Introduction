Accidents are happening very common in these days due to increase of vehicles based on their usage and environment pollution caused by these vehicles . Every day, almost 3,700 people are killed globally in road traffic crashes involving cars, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, trucks, or pedestrians. So, I am going to develop a machine learning model, using the data provided by the  Organization SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group, to alert the drivers about the severity of the accident to be happen in that place, climate conditions and many other features too .
